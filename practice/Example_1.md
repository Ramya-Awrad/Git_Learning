## Initialize a new repository 

`mkdir git-practice`  
`cd git-practice`  
`git init`   

### What it does:
- It creates a hidden folder called `.git` that stores:
    - All version History
    - commits
    - Branches
    - Configuration
- After running this your folder becomes a Git-enabled project.
- To see `.git` folder run: `ls -a`
- without `git init`, Git won't track anything.
