| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository (Repo)**    | A directory tracked by Git, containing all project files and version history. |
| **Working Directory**    | The current checked-out version of the project files.                         |
| **Staging Area (Index)** | Area where changes are prepared before committing.                            |
| **Commit**               | A snapshot of the project's tracked files at a point in time.                 |
| **Branch**               | A separate line of development in a repository.                               |
| **HEAD**                 | A pointer to the current branch reference or commit.                          |
| **Remote**               | A version of your repository hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub).                 |
| **Clone**                | Creating a local copy of a remote repository.                                 |
| **Pull**                 | Fetch and integrate changes from a remote branch into the current branch.     |
| **Push**                 | Upload local branch commits to a remote repository.                           |


## Branching & Merging:

| Concept                | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Merge**              | Combining two branches' changes into one.                    |
| **Rebase**             | Reapplying commits on top of another base tip.               |
| **Fast-forward Merge** | A merge where no new commits are needed (history is linear). |
| **Three-way Merge**    | Used when thereâ€™s divergence between branches.               |
| **Conflict**           | Happens when Git can't automatically merge changes.          |


## History & Inspection:

| **Diff**   | Shows changes between commits, branches, or working directory and index. |
| **Status** | Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.       |
| **Blame**  | Shows which commit and author last modified each line of a file.         |
| **Show**   | Displays various types of Git objects (commits, tags, etc.).             |

| **Upstream**        | The main repo/branch your branch is tracking.       |

## Undo & recovery:

| Concept      | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reset**    | Moves HEAD and optionally changes index/working directory.         |
| **Revert**   | Creates a new commit that undoes the effects of a previous commit. |
| **Checkout** | Switches branches or restores working tree files.                  |
| **Stash**    | Temporarily shelves changes without committing them.               |
| **Clean**    | Removes untracked files from the working directory.                |


## Advanced concpets:

| Concept         | Description                                                    |

| **Cherry-pick** | Apply changes from a specific commit to another branch.        |
| **Submodule**   | Repository embedded within another repository.                 |
